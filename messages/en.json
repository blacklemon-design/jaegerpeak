    "fheader2": "Questions",
    "f1_q": "Do I need prior knowledge or already be fit?",
    "f1_a": "You don’t need any prior knowledge. All training is individually adapted to your current level – whether you are starting out, coming back, or aiming to improve your performance.",
    "f2_q": "What if I don’t master the technique?",
    "f2_a": "No problem. I’ll teach you the technique step by step and place great importance on clean execution. This way we maximize your training and prevent injuries.",
    "f3_q": "Is there a trial session? How does it work?",
    "f3_a": "Yes. In the trial session, I analyze your movement patterns, mobility, and current condition. We start with a conversation, followed by a check of your basic movements, then we define the next steps.",
    "f4_q": "How much does the training cost?",
    "f4_a": "Everyone starts with different goals and conditions, which is why my prices are individual. Together we define the program that fits you and how intensively we work together. You only pay for what you really need. Real and lasting change comes from consistent training over several months. That’s why personal coaching is only available in multi-month programs. For athletic training, single sessions are also possible.",
    "f5_q": "Where do we train?",
    "f5_a": "That depends on your goal. Depending on the training: at Kraftwerk Fitness in Heerbrugg, on the 400m track in Balgach, or on the tennis court (TC Widnau or by arrangement).",
    "f6_q": "How often do I need to train to see changes?",
    "f6_a": "That depends on your goal and starting point. As a rule, I recommend at least 2 sessions per week to achieve noticeable progress. Consistency is the most important success factor.",
    "f7_q": "Do you also train women? How old do I need to be?",
    "f7_a": "Of course. I train both women and men, depending on the goal – whether muscle building, toning, or functional training for pain prevention. I don’t set strict age limits. Generally, my target group is between 12 and 60 years old. In the free consultation, we will clarify together whether cooperation makes sense.",
    "f8_q": "What if I get sick?",
    "f8_a": "You can reschedule sessions on time – we’ll define the details in the coaching contract. The goal is to keep your progress structured but flexible if something comes up.",
    "f9_q": "Can I also be coached online?",
    "f9_a": "Yes. Depending on your training goal, I can coach you online – with a training plan, video feedback, and regular 1:1 communication. Ideal if you want to train flexibly and independent of location.",
    "f10_q": "How does working together look like?",
    "f10_a": "After the initial consultation, we create your training plan and start with the coaching – including 1:1 support, training plan, nutrition tips, and regular reflection.",

    "htext": "My name is Ramon Jäger, born in 2000, and I have been active in sports since childhood. At the age of four, I started playing football at FC Widnau and discovered my passion for ball sports. At twelve, I switched to tennis because I realized: I thrive in a sport where my own performance alone determines victory or defeat. At 19, alongside my mechanical engineering studies, I started weight training in the gym. The visible progress over the following six years filled me with pride and awakened the desire to share my knowledge. Today, I pursue this path professionally. In April 2025, I completed my SAFS-certified fitness trainer education and then specialized as an Athletic Performance Trainer.",
